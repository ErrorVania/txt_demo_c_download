The demo program shows the distance operation of the encoder motor. It is recommended that you plug a rest gear wheel 137677 to the axle and highlight a wheel. The program switches the motor for 2 rotations, then waits for a second and carries out the same number of rotations in the opposite direction. Then the program ends.
> Master TXT:

> - Output M1	Encoder motor
 
> - Input C1	Counter signal of the encoder motor
